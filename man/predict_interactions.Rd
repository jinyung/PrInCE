\usage{
predict_interactions(
  features,
  gold_standard,
  classifier = c("NB", "SVM", "RF", "LR", "ensemble"),
  verbose = FALSE,
  models = 10,
  cv_folds = 10,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{features}{a data frame with proteins in the first two columns, and
features to be passed to the classifier in the remaining columns}

\item{gold_standard}{an adjacency matrix of "gold standard" interactions
used to train the classifier}

\item{classifier}{the type of classifier to use: one of \code{"NB"} (naive
Bayes), \code{"SVM"} (support vector machine), \code{"RF"} (random forest),
\code{"LR"} (logistic regression), or \code{"ensemble"} (an ensemble of
all four)}

\item{verbose}{if \code{TRUE}, print a series of messages about the stage
of the analysis}

\item{models}{the number of classifiers to train and average across, each
with a different k-fold cross-validation split}

\item{cv_folds}{the number of folds to use for k-fold cross-validation}

\item{trees}{for random forests only, the number of trees in the forest}

\item{negative_ratio}{let the ratio of positive:negative labels be 1:n.
This changes n. default is NA, which do not change the ratio of negatives.}
}
\value{
a ranked data frame of pairwise interactions, with the
classifier score, label, and cumulative precision for each interaction
}
\description{
Discriminate interacting from non-interacting protein pairs by training a
machine learning model on a set of labelled examples, given a set of
features derived from a co-elution profile matrix (see
\code{\link[PrInCE]{calculate_features}}.
}
\details{
PrInCE implements four different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector
machine, random forest, and logistic regression). Naive Bayes is used as a
default. The classifiers are trained
on the gold standards using a ten-fold cross-validation procedure, training
on 90% of the data and predicting on the remaining 10%. For protein pairs
that are part of the training data, the held-out split is used to assign
a classifier score, whereas for the remaining protein pairs, the median of
all ten folds is used. Furthermore, to ensure the results are not sensitive
to the precise classifier split used, an ensemble of multiple classifiers
(ten, by default) is trained, and the classifier score is subsequently
averaged across classifiers.

PrInCE can also ensemble across multiple different types of classifiers,
by supplying the \code{"ensemble"} option to the \code{classifier} argument.
