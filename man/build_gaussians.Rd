\arguments{
\item{profile_matrix}{a numeric matrix of co-elution profiles, with proteins
in rows, or a \code{\linkS4class{MSnSet}} object}

\item{min_points}{filter profiles without at least this many total, 
non-missing points; passed to \code{\link{filter_profiles}}}

\item{min_consecutive}{filter profiles without at least this many 
consecutive, non-missing points; passed to \code{\link{filter_profiles}}}

\item{impute_NA}{if true, impute single missing values with the average of
neighboring values; passed to \code{\link{clean_profiles}}}

\item{smooth}{if true, smooth the chromatogram with a moving average filter;
passed to \code{\link{clean_profiles}}}

\item{smooth_width}{width of the moving average filter, in fractions;
passed to \code{\link{clean_profiles}}}

\item{max_gaussians}{the maximum number of Gaussians to fit; defaults to 5.
Note that Gaussian mixtures with more parameters than observed (i.e., 
non-zero or NA) points will not be fit. Passed to  
\code{\link{choose_gaussians}}}

\item{criterion}{the criterion to use for model selection;
one of "AICc" (corrected AIC, and default), "AIC", or "BIC". Passed to
\code{\link{choose_gaussians}}}

\item{max_iterations}{the number of times to try fitting the curve with
different initial conditions; defaults to 50. Passed to 
\code{\link{fit_gaussians}}}

\item{min_R_squared}{the minimum R-squared value to accept when fitting the
curve with different initial conditions; defaults to 0.5. Passed to 
\code{\link{fit_gaussians}}}

\item{method}{the method used to select the initial conditions for
nonlinear least squares optimization (one of "guess" or "random"); 
see \code{\link{make_initial_conditions}} for details. Passed to 
\code{\link{fit_gaussians}}}

\item{filter_gaussians_center}{true or false: filter Gaussians whose centres
fall outside the bounds of the chromatogram. Passed to 
\code{\link{fit_gaussians}}}

\item{filter_gaussians_height}{Gaussians whose heights are below this 
fraction of the chromatogram height will be filtered. Setting this value to
zero disables height-based filtering of fit Gaussians. Passed to 
\code{\link{fit_gaussians}}}

\item{filter_gaussians_variance_min}{Gaussians whose variance falls below 
this number of fractions will be filtered. Setting this value to
zero disables filtering. Passed to 
\code{\link{fit_gaussians}}}

\item{filter_gaussians_variance_max}{Gaussians whose variance is above
this number of fractions will be filtered. Setting this value to
zero disables filtering. Passed to 
\code{\link{fit_gaussians}}}
}
\value{
a list of fit Gaussian mixture models, where each item in the 
list contains the following five fields: the number of Gaussians used to fit
the curve; the R^2 of the fit; the number of iterations used to 
fit the curve with different initial conditions; the coefficients of the 
fit model; and the curve predicted by the fit model. Profiles that 
could not be fit by a Gaussian mixture model above the minimum R-squared 
cutoff will be absent from the returned list.
}
\description{
Identify peaks in co-fractionation profiles by deconvolving peaks in 
Gaussian mixture models. Models are mixtures of between 1 and 5 Gaussians.
Profiles are pre-processed prior to building Gaussians by filtering and 
cleaning. By default, profiles with fewer than 5 non-missing points, or 
fewer than 5 consecutive points after imputation of single missing values,
are removed. Profiles are cleaned by replacing missing values with 
near-zero noise, imputing single missing values as the mean of neighboring 
points, and smoothing with a moving average filter.
